A truth table, that uses neural network to solve logic. The Program is set to solve up to 6 inputs and 4 outputs.
  At start up the user will be greeted with a setup page, where the user can select the name, and the number of both
  inputs and outputs. After the setup process the other three tabs (train, test, visualize network) will be enabled.
  Half of the inputs will be enumerated for train, and test, to prove that the neural network can solve a given logic,
  without ever encountering that logic before*. In the visualization tab, a graph representation of the neural network
  will be shown. Through the representation of the graph the user can see which of the inputs had biggest factor in
  deciding the output.
